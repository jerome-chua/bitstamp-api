## Questions

**2. Which took the most time? What did you find most difficult?**

> Reading up more on server-sent events to understand more on ways to update systems in an efficient way. Being more familiar with TDD with APIs (this is new to me).

**3. If we wanted the balance to update on the frontend more often (10 times per second), how would you improve the current system to handle this?**

> Instead of using Express on the backend, we could directly query the API within a `<script>` tag within the HTML/browser of the "wallet" page.

**4. How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them!**

> Think question 3 subtly hinted at a frontend to be done, I think being clearer about that could be helpful, understand though candidates can ask questions. Thanks.
